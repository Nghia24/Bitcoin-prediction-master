Bitcoin has recently received a lot of attention from the public due to its recent price surge and crash. Correspondingly, many researchers have investigated various factors that affect the Bitcoin price and the patterns behind its fluctuations, in particular, using various machine learning methods. In this paper, using a data set of bitcoin price from 2017 to 2020, we study and compare various methods: 5 machine learning and deep learning models (LSTM, GRU, ARIMA, Facebook Prophet and SVM). Experimental results show that of all prediction models, GRU-based models outperform other models in predicting bitcoin price, other models show good representation of bitcoin price in the stock market with approximately similar accuracy except for Facebookâ€™s prophet and SVM.
